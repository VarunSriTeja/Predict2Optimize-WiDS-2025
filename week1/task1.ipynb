    "Formally we can treat volatility as a *conditional standard deviation of returns*, conditioned on the history observed so far. We *cannot* predict *true* volatility for a given day based on the single return value, hence we try to estimate it using the past information. For this we look at two indicators of volatility:\n",

    "  - 20-day EWMA volatility (*RiskMetrics*) with $\\alpha=0.94$.\n",
    "    It is described by the formula: $\\sigma_t^2 = (1-\\lambda)r_t^2 + \\lambda \\sigma_{t-1}^2$.\n",

    "- Plot Both on the same chart\n",
    "- Analyze their effectiveness:\n",
